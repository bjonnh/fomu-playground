# fomu-playground
A repository in which I put my Fomu (https://tomu.im/fomu.html) experiments.

## How to use

You need to have the Fomu Toolchain in your PATH. See the [Workshop](https://github.com/im-tomu/fomu-workshop) for more information.

## Litex_things

I took the litex shared with the 2019 workshop.

### 00_touchrgb.py

This was my first attempt at connecting things together. This one
connect the touch sensors (this would require more work to get them
working reliably) to the rgb leds.

By touchin your Fomu on the side at different points, you should see
different colors on the RGB LED.
